# HurricaneModel.jl

This is a Julia implementation of the "Hurricane model", a disease modelling idea explored during one of the Extended Field's Workshops on Data Science and Analytics.

This code is rough and undocumented, but I am making it public for anyone interested.

The idea was to unite the original hurricane model, and some variations on that which used compartmental models, under a common interface to make them easily extensible, but I never had time to finish that.
